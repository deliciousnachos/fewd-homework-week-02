# CSS LAB!

This week we're going to be doing something a little differently: all lab, all day.

### ON THE AGENDA:

- Reviewing the past week's homework
- Adding another page to our Relaxr site

## GETTING STARTED:

- Hopefully your homework is in a good enough spot that we can work directly with it!
- If not, that's okay. There is starter code in the `starter-code` directory.
- Either keep working on your same homework files **OR** create a new folder called `in-class-work` in the repo you made for your homework.
    - Take all of the code & images in this `starter-code` directory and put it into your new `in-class-work` directory

## WHAT WE'RE MAKING

We're going to be working on making a blog page for our Relaxr site! Here's the image we'll be working from:

We'll be tackling this together in two stages.

### Stage 1

- Get in a group of 3-5 people.
- In your group, draw out the layout of the blog.
- Divide up the layout into what divs you'll need, what classes you think each div should have, etc.
- We will go over this together, and write out some of the HTML.

### Stage 2

- In your same groups, work on taking the unstyled HTML, and creating the styles to match the layout.
- Plan carefully what you're going to need to have in your code _before_ you start coding. 

## Please note!

Although you will be discussing this as a group, please make sure you have an updated version of the relaxr site in your own repo. You will be turning this in for homework.
